My project vision would be a basketball statistics database. Being a fan of the NBA, statistics are a very important part of determining one’s greatness, and numbers don’t lie. However, I would style my database to reflect sites such as ESPN or Basketball Reference. I would love to be able to incorporate a way to live update every day or every 12 hours or something. How complex that would be, I’m not sure, but I think this project would be good practice for handling a large amount of data and organizing it into a searchable and understandable format.

-- This command file loads an experimental person relation.
-- The data conforms to the following assumptions:
--     * Person IDs and team names are unique for people and teams respectively.
--     * People can have at most one mentor.
--     * People can be on many teams, but only have one role per team.
--     * Teams meet at only one time.

--Exercise 4.1a
	--This schema violates a lot of the requirements for various levels of normalized form. There are a disgusting amount of NULL values in this relation.
		-- A lot of these attributes should be in their own separate tables. The lack of primary and foreign keys is incredibly disturbing. There will be no 
		-- way to uniquely identify ANY records, potentially resulting in duplicate records, wasting database space. 
	--We must determine whether or not this relation is in BCNF or 4NF.
		--All the left hand sides of the non-trivial functional dependencies must be a superkey of the relation. What we see here is not the case at all. There
			-- is no mechanism in place that confirms that the superkey uniquely identifies the attributes of a relation. Thus, this requirement is violated. 
			-- We also see that the only real primary key is (personId, teamId). But personId functionally defines name, thus violating BCNF requirements.
			
--Exercise 4.1b
	--Properly normalized schema:
		--Person(personId, name, status, mentorId)
		--Team(teamId, teamName, role, time)
		--Person_Team(personId, teamId)
		
	--This schema is in BCNF. For each functional dependency in the table, the left hand side of each f.d. is a superkey for the relation.

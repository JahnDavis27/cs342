10a. Does Oracle handle the transaction life-cycle (see Figure 20.4) with respect to starting and stopping SQL*Plus sessions?
		- Oracle rollbacks to the start of the current sqlplus session (or the most recent commit) upon the stopping of the sqlplus session if there has not been a manual commit or autocommit is
		not enabled. 
		
		
10b. Can we implement any of the ACID properties using START-TRANSACTION/SAVEPOINT/ROLLBACK/COMMIT?
		- These operations aren't enough to ensure that ACID properties are being used. We have to use the proper lock mechanisms in order to make sure that ACID is enforced. When
		transactions occur, we must lock whatever is being read or changed so that it cannot be interfered with by a separate SQL*Plus session.

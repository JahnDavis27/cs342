Views (Section 7.3, for Monday)

a. Write a simple view specification. For details on Oracle views, see Managing Views.
	CREATE VIEW Performed_In
	AS SELECT C.performerID, C.movieID
	FROM Performer P, Casting C
	WHERE P.ID = C.performerID AND C.movieID IS NOT NULL;

b. Define the following terms (in the comments of your SQL command file).

	i. Base Tables
		-Tables whose tuples are always physically stored in the database

	ii. Join Views
		-Views that specify more than one base table or view in the FROM clause
	
	iii. Updateable Join Views
		-A join view where UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE operations are allowed
	
	iv. Key-Preserved Tables
		-A table where every key of the table can also be a key of the result of the join
	
	v. Views that are implemented via query modification vs materialization. (For details on Oracle materialization, see Materialized View Concepts and Architecture, focusing on the “What is a Materialized View?” and “Why Use Materialized Views” sections.)

--The dual table is a dummy table that contatins a single record that is used where the user
--  does not really care about the data, but wants the results of a system function in a SELECT
--  statement. 
-- For example, we cannot use the query "SELECT 3+4". but we CAN use the query "SELECT 3+4 FROM DUAL"
--  as a workaround.

Exercise 2.2
a. I believe that a constraint could be added to the table based on a new column in the Movie table (i.e upVotes). The value would have to be an integer that was larger than 1000. 
Therefore, a constraint could be added to that schema that looked like:

	CHECK ((score = null) or (score is NOT NULL and votes > 1000)).

b. I believe separating a constraint from a table definition would be applicable to a situation where a table has records in it that are referenced somewhere else. Therefore, the 
referencing records could be updated once the constraint is removed, and then once this process is done, the constraint can be reapplied to the referenced table.

1a) Compare and contrast the database and the software design processes. Are agile modeling 
practices applicable to database design as well?
*	These design  processes are actually quite similar. Although there are some practices that are 
typically applicable to the software design process, changes in the industry and how database 
can be accessed and implemented into software applications, such as mobile apps. Therefore, 
there are some agile modeling practices that can play a part into database design processes of 
the present day. 
1b) Explain the following terms: entities, relationships (including cardinality and participation 
constraints), attributes (simple, composite, multi-valued and derived).
*	Entity – a thing or object in the real world with an independent existence; may be an object with 
a physical or conceptual existence
*	Attribute – The particular properties that describe an entity
o	Simple – attributes that are not divisible
o	Composite – can be divided into smaller subparts which represent more basic attributes 
with independent meanings
o	Multivalued – can have a set of values (attributes) for a single entity; may have upper 
and lower bounds to constrain the number of values allowed for each entity
o	Derived – an attribute that can be given a value based upon the value of other attributes 
(i.e. age from birthdate)
*	Relationships
o	Cardinality – specifies the maximum number of relationship instances that an entity can 
participate in
o	Participation constraint – specifies whether the existence of an entity depends on its 
being related to another entity via the relationship type
1c) Explain weak entities and identifying relationships.
o	Weak entities are entities that have no key attributes of their own, which makes them weak. 
o	Identifying relationships  occur when entities belonging to a weak entity are identified by being 
related to specific entities from another entity type in combination with one of their attribute 
values.

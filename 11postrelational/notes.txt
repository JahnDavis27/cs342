11.1c) The Glassfish application server resides on the server side of the program, and is used often in the J2EE edition. The JDK 
is more associated with J2SE, which is the standard edition of Java that most people used ot fulfill their needs. 

11.1d) This runs at the client tier. 

11.1e) This uses the Glassfish server. The localhost used is a different number.

11.1f) A WAR file (or Web application ARchive) is a JAR file used to distribute a collection of JavaServer Pages, Java Servlets, 
Java classes, XML files, tag libraries, static web pages (HTML and related files) and other resources that together constitute a web 
application.

11.1g) "Exploded" means than instead of deploying a WAR/EAR file to your application server to test your application, you point your 
application server at a folder containing the unzipped (exploded) contents of what would be inside the WAR/EAR file. A non-exploded WAR file
simply hasn't been unzipped yet. 

11.1h) A WAR file may be digitally signed in the same way as a JAR file in order to allow others to determine where the source code came from.
An EAR file is a standard JAR file (and therefore a Zip file) with a .ear extension, with one or more entries representing the modules of the 
application, and a metadata directory called META-INF which contains one or more deployment descriptors. An EAR file can contain a WAR file.

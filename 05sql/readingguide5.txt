1. Basic SQL (Section 6.3) — Review basic SQL as needed, then write sample queries that:
a. Use one or more tuple variables (Section 6.3.2).
- SELECT M.title, M.year, M.score 
FROM Movie AS M
WHERE M.title = ‘Star Wars’ 
b. Use one or more of the set operations, e.g., UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT (Section 6.3.4).
- (SELECT DISTINCT movieId
FROM Performer, Casting
WHERE performerId =  Id 
AND firstName = ‘Harrison’)

UNION 

(SELECT DISTINCT movieId…???)

2. Advanced SQL (Sections 7.1.1–7.1.5) — This will include more new material; write sample queries that:
a. Select based on a NULL field value (Section 7.1.1).
- SELECT firstName 
FROM Performer
WHERE lastName IS NULL
b. Implement a nested sub-query, using [NOT] EXISTS, IN, ANY or ALL (Sections 7.1.2–7.1.4).
- SELECT firstName
FROM Performer
WHERE ID > ALL 	(SELECT id FROM Performer WHERE id = 1)
c. Implement a correlated sub-query (Section 7.1.3).
- SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName
FROM Performer AS P, Casting AS C
WHERE P.id = C.performerID AND
